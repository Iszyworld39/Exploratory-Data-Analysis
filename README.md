# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights within a dataset. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis, WHICH helpS to 
understand the structure, relationships, and potential issues within the data before proceeding with modeling or decision-making.

## Project Overview

The analysis covers:

* Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
* Data Visualization: Using charts and graphs to explore distributions and correlations.
* Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
* Outlier Detection: Identifying unusual data points that may affect the analysis.

## Data Structure

* The dataset used in this project consists of multiple features relevant to the analysis. The main data files include:
* raw_data.csv – The original dataset before preprocessing.
* cleaned_data.csv – The dataset after handling missing values and inconsistencies.
* eda_summary_report.xlsx – A summary of key findings from the EDA process.

## Key Features

* Comprehensive Data Profiling: In-depth examination of data structure and quality.
* Visual Analysis: Using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps for insights.
* Statistical Summaries: Generating descriptive statistics to understand distributions.
* Anomaly Detection: Identifying outliers and inconsistencies in data.
* Metrics Relationships: Exploring dependencies between variables for better analysis.

## How to Run the Project

* Access the repository: https://github.com/Iszyworld39/exploratory-data-analysis
* Navigate to the project directory: exploratory-data-analysis
* Open and explore the dataset files located in the /data directory.
* Use Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to analyze the data, clean missing values, and generate insights.
* Create visualizations using built-in chart tools to explore patterns and relationships within the dataset
